# YarnProject

## Description
A simple bit of code to recommend yarns for crochet and knitting projects. 
Takes in the URL for any pattern on ravelry.com

I hope this tiny project can help those unfamilar with yarn types to chose a material that is appropriate to their fiber arts project. 
I'm a crocheter myself, and worked with some non-coder crochet and knitting friends to make sure to consider the important characteristics of a yarn. 
I suspect this tool could also be useful for other yarn based fiber arts such as weaving, but as I don't know the technical details of these arts I can't be sure. If any exerienced weavers or practitioners of other fibers are have a moment, I'd love feedback on the yarn recommendations. 

WARNING: this code is note yet minimally functional. Updates are comming soon.
I'll also be implementing a function to suggest substitution yarns based on any yarn on ravelry.com
Feel free to suggest other features.

## Installation
Copy the file "YarnDB yarn selector.py" to your directory and machine. 
Run the file, this will prompt you to input the URL to the pattern you would like yarn suggestions for.
Please make sure to input the full URL for your pattern, such as https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/velvet-cache-cou

Please note that this code interacts with the Ravelry API, and so requires an internet connection, and depends on Ravelry being functional when you run the code. 

## Requirements
Requires the following python modules:
